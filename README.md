### Functionality

This is the [Event Manager](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/event-manager-ruby-programming) project, which pulls in a list of event attendees, looks up their government representatives based on their zip codes, and generates personalized .html emails.

### Thoughts

This project was very straightforward, since The Odin Project holds your hand for most of it. I appreciated that, since it involved quite a few new concepts. This was the first project involving file I/O and parsing a .csv file. This project was also the first time I encountered .erb template files, and the process of creating them and generating .html files from them. It all made enough sense, though I think if I have to do it again, I'll probably have to come back to this project for reference.

This project did not walk me through the final assignments, which involved cleaning phone numbers and working with times and dates. Those final steps - particularly the times and dates - were quite new to me, and I had to do a fair bit of reading to understand how to properly parse and format dates. Ultimately it made sense, however, and I'm glad I learned it.

One particularly strong aspect of this project was that the data in the csv was somewhat messy, and therefore realistic. This was a good exercise in cleaning input data. The project also proceeded in a good way - not immediately jumping to each solution, but procedurally taking logical steps, and then exploring ways to refactor or use preexisting solutions. It helped me better learn the programming workflow.

God bless.
